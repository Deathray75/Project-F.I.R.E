Android is brought to a whole new level. 
Ios and android never mixed the project knows as FIRE will mix the two of the best mobile operating system into one.
The project is also knows as project DRAGON but for now remains as FIRE.
Dreamboard will be used for the mix and the final project name will be sold but everything is in beta and is not to be 
sold without permission (the maker of dreamboard NOT ME)

THe project is being commited for public conspumtion and will be made for easy use of using Dreamboard and creating themes

It is reccomend not to try and place this on an IOS device currently its in beta and not much progress has been made i will not be
held responsible for any broken or damaged device.

Also it is reccomened that NO member of the public to fork this as it could leave ones ipod iphone or ipad damaged
once completed it will be open sourced and will be for public consumption after this and The project will be abanned.

Later on a new project know as Redemption will be worked on and the final project will be sold. But this is all in a few months maybe a year, I dont know.

and last note if the project is forked and develop on i WILL NOT accepted the modified codes please only fork the code workon it as a seperate code

And also there are no eta for when project redmeption nor when dragon will start and finish

thank you.
